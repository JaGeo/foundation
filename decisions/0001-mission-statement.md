# Materials Project Software Foundation Mission Statement

## Context and Problem Statement

The Materials Project Software Foundation seeks to better coordinate development activity among Materials Project stakeholders. A clear statement of purpose is essential
for doing so most effectively and communicating our activities to outside parties.

## Considered Options

### Proposal #1

> The mission of the Materials Project Software Foundation is to provide **community-driven**, **inclusive**, **coordinated**, **transparent**, and **accountable** governance of select public-facing and open-source Materials Project software packages.

> We seek to be **community-driven** by considering the needs of a broad cross-section of our users when making development decisions.

> We seek to be **inclusive** by taking intentional steps to make our meetings, discussions, and tools accessible, welcoming and respectful to contributors regardless level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

> We seek to be **coordinated** by promoting consistency and mutual compatibility among our codes, documentation, and training materials.

> We seek to be **transparent** by publicly documenting major development decisions and providing opportunities for community members to give feedback on them.

> We seek to be **accountable** by empowering Foundation members or users to alert us if they feel a development decision or misconduct within the community is undermining this mission.
