# Materials Project Software Foundation 

## Mission
The mission of the Materials Project Software Foundation is to provide **community-driven, inclusive, coordinated, transparent, and accountable governance** of select public-facing and open-source Materials Project software packages.

We seek to be community-driven by considering the needs of a broad cross-section of our users when making development decisions.

We seek to be inclusive by taking intentional steps to make our meetings, discussions, and tools accessible, welcoming and respectful to contributors regardless level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

We seek to be coordinated by promoting consistency and mutual compatibility among our codes, documentation, and training materials.

We seek to be transparent by publicly documenting major development decisions and providing opportunities for community members to give feedback on them.

We seek to be accountable by empowering Foundation members or users to alert us if they feel a development decision or misconduct within the community is undermining this mission.


## Decision Records

This repository contains records of decisions made by the Materials Project Software Foundation. Decisions are made available in [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format, and contain a *brief* summary of a decision, its context and the various options considered. It is hoped that making these decisions publicly available will reinforce the Materials Project's commitment to transparency, and provide useful information to those hoping to get involved in the project.
